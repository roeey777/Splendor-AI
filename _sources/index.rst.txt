Splendor-AI
===========

Special Thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We would like to thank Prof. Nir Lipovetzky, an instructor in `COMP90054 “AI Planning for Autonomy” <https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2024/subjects/comp90054>`_ course of the University of Melbourne. The
course staff have organized a contest for autonomous agents for the game
Splendor, developed by the students. We’ve contancted associate
Prof. Nir Lipovetzky ( `Github <https://github.com/nirlipo>`_ , `Mail <nir.lipovetzky@unimelb.edu.au>`_ ) of `Melbourne University <https://www.unimelb.edu.au/>`_  and he provided us with
their implementation of the game engine. From there we’ve started
tweeking the game engine a bit for our needs (like adding the ``generatePredecessor`` method to ``SplendorGameRule`` ).
